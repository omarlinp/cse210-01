The program contains two classes: User and Card
the class User that creates the blueprint for the player of the game and the class 

the class User only inclues the basic information that we need about the players like the starting score. 

the class Card contains the starting information from the card and the method that will be needed to generate new cards. 

the randint function that was imported at the beginig of the code is to generate the cards withing the paramenter that we are giving, in this case we want the cards from 1 - 13

the computer_decision functions generates a new card and then changes the score of the player depeding on wether his answer was right or not and then will return the new card. 

this version of the game has been developed by myself.
